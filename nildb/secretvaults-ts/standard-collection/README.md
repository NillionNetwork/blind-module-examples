# Working with Standard Collections in Nillion Private Storage

[Nillion Private Storage](https://docs.nillion.com/build/private-storage/overview) keeps sensitive data secret by storing encrypted shares across a cluster of nilDB nodes. Each nilDB node stores a separate share of the encrypted data, ensuring no single node can reveal the original value.

There are 2 [collections types](https://docs.nillion.com/build/private-storage/overview#collection-types) within Nillion Private Storage

1. Standard Collections
2. User Owned Collections

This folder has reference examples for working with Standard Collections
